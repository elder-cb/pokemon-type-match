# PokemonTypeMatch

An interactive table to highlight the most/least effective move types when fighting with Pok√©mon.

Hovering the table will highlight both the row and the column, clicking on a cell will keep both row and column highlighted; hovering after clicking will still highlight the table with a lighter colour to allow easier comparison.

Click again on the same cell to deselect both row and column, or click just on the selected column or row header to deselect them.

Multiple columns and/or rows can be selected at the same time to allow multiple comparisons also on mobile.
